# hello-world
My programming journey starts here....

# **This is the beginning**
This is a repo created for me to upload the tiny simple python programs I write for practice, nothing more really...Will update this as I go!
> Edit (May 6th 2023):
- I only upload practice programs that I write from scratch to this repo (not those that I did following the book or whichever exercise I might be following)
> Edit (June 11th 2023):
- Added a new oop (object-oriented programming) practice program called "Restaurant-oop", this basically creates few classes with attributes related to specific restaurants, their names and cuisine types. Plus users and their info as well.
- Also added a ticTacToe game.

> Edit (Nov 28th 2024):
- Added a new mini app called "mapIt" which is ran through a simple batch script (multi-platform). It grabs whatever physical address copied to clipboard, then automatically runs it through google maps by opening a browser window/tab. Very useful for data entry work.
